chr
---

R package for simple string manipulation

*this package is in early development*

Description
-----------

Clean, wrangle, and parse character \[string\] vectors using base exclusively base R functions.

Install
-------

``` r
## install from github
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mkearney/chr")

## load chr
library(chr)
```

Usage
-----

`chr` offers lightweight functionality similar to [`stringr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr). For example, say you have some text that needs taming, e.g., Twitter data:

``` r
## get text to manipulate
rt <- rtweet::search_tweets("lang:en", n = 500)
```

### Extract

**Extract** text patterns.

``` r
## some tweets with 'their', 'there', or 'they're'
rt$text[c(5, 9, 34, 76, 84, 157, 256)]
```

    ## [1] "RT @ZarrarKhuhro: All students who misbehave will have their names noted down and marks will be deducted from their final grade https://t.c…"
    ## [2] "RT @therealroseanne: how could we have fallen for Obama? OMG"

### n-grams

Create **ngram**s at the character.

``` r
## character vector
x <- c("Acme Pizza, Inc.", "Tom's Sports Equipment, LLC")

## 2 char level ngram
chr_ngram_char(x, n = 2L)

## 3 char level ngram in lower case and stripped of punctation and white space
chr_ngram_char(x, n = 3L, lower = TRUE, punct = TRUE, space = TRUE)
```
